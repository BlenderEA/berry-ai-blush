Decentralizing the Creator Economy for Adult Content on Solana
Version 1.0 - Published: May 2025

Abstract
Busty Berry is a decentralized, blockchain-based platform designed to empower adult content creators by providing a secure, transparent, and efficient alternative to centralized platforms like OnlyFans. Built on the Solana blockchain, Busty Berry leverages high-throughput, low-cost transactions to enable creators to monetize their content, engage with fans, and maintain ownership of their data and revenue streams.

By integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) principles, non-custodial wallets, and community governance, Busty Berry redefines the adult content industry, prioritizing creator autonomy, user privacy, and financial inclusion.

1. Introduction
The adult content industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by platforms like OnlyFans, which enable creators to monetize their content directly. However, centralized platforms often impose high fees, restrict creator earnings, enforce opaque content moderation policies, and retain control over user data. These challenges limit creator autonomy and expose users to risks such as deplatforming and data breaches.

Busty Berry addresses these issues by leveraging the Solana blockchain to create a decentralized, creator-centric platform. By utilizing Solana's high-speed, low-cost transactions, Busty Berry offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for creators and fans. The platform introduces the Busty Berry Token ($Busty), a utility token that powers transactions, subscriptions, tipping, and governance within the ecosystem.

1.1 Vision
Busty Berry aims to empower adult content creators by providing a decentralized platform that prioritizes:

Creator Ownership: Full control over content, revenue, and fan relationships
User Privacy: Secure, pseudonymous interactions without reliance on centralized data storage
Low Fees: Cost-effective transactions enabled by Solana's high-throughput blockchain
Community Governance: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for transparent decision-making

1.2 Problem Statement
Centralized adult content platforms face several challenges:

High Fees: Platforms often charge 20-30% of creator earnings, reducing profitability
Content Moderation: Arbitrary content removal and account bans disrupt creator livelihoods
Data Privacy: Centralized databases are vulnerable to hacks and data leaks
Payment Restrictions: Traditional payment processors impose limitations, excluding creators in certain regions
Lack of Transparency: Opaque algorithms and policies limit creator control
